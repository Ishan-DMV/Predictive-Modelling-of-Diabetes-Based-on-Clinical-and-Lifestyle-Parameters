# Predictive-Modelling-of-Diabetes-Based-on-Clinical-and-Lifestyle-Parameters

Early detection of diabetes helps to control adverse health problems. We have proposed a system that predicts diabetes based on different parameters. The objective of this research work involves creating a prediction system for diabetes diagnosis using multiple lifestyle elements and medical data. This study involved implementation of  various machine learning models like Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), and AdaBoost. We also implemented a deep learning-based model, Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP). The KNN model achieved the highest accuracy but required a longer prediction time. Considering the accuracy and prediction time, Random Forest maintained the balance and gave better results. This research demonstrates the use of machine learning models for early and efficient detection of diabetes.
